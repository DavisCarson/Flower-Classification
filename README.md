# Flower-Classification
This project implements a simple neural network from scratch in Python to classify iris flowers into three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. The model is built with customizable input, hidden, and output layers and is trained using backpropagation with sigmoid activation.
